# Health-Protest-Tracker-System-using-NLP
Collect data from social media platform(Twitter), analyze it using Natural  Language Processing

In this project I hope to collect data from social media platform, analyse it using Natural 
Language Processing, and consolidate it so that it can determine the prevalence of protest, as 
well as its characteristics, such as who is involved, the issues being challenged, the protest 
action taken, their demand, the location, size and duration of the protest also the current status 
of the protest carried out and the impact of the strikes
